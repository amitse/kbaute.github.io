<b>How well do you think you understand the air we breathe?</b> <br> What is the air made of? <br> How does it cycle through our environment? <br> How do we affect it? <br> What is Climate Change?
</p>
<p>
A substantial portion of the public is unable to answer those basic science questions, and perhaps that is why <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/poll-abacus-carbon-tax-1.4603824">  nearly a third </a> of Canadians do not believe that humanity is causing Climate Change. Meanwhile, <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00704-015-1597-5"> scientists are all on board </a> with the fact that its happening, and its our fault.
</p>
<p>
This is really important, so I decided to set out on a project to help answer those questions for people. I wanted to really engage with people about this topic. I didn’t want to show people numbers, I wanted to connect with them on an emotional level. So, I went on an adventure, and I put myself at risk, in order to give a human face to the issues that our invisible atmosphere is facing.
</p>
<p>
 <b>I built 30,000L jar, filled it with 200 plants, and sealed myself inside.</b> The plan was to demonstrate how our air moves from our lungs, into the air, to plants, and back, and how that system is fragile.

</p>
<p>
Yes, there was some real risk to me personally going into this, but we are risking the lives of millions of people by not taking action against climate change. I also took many steps to make this as low risk as I was comfortable with, but <b>don’t try this at home.</b>
</p>

</p>
<p>
It didn’t go as planned. But, as much as I planned and prepared, I also expected that something unexpected would probably happen. If unexpected issues would cause oxygen levels to plummet in a 200 million dollar enclosed biodome named Biosphere 2, then surely my tiny, homemade biodome would have more than its fair-share of issues.

</p>
<p>
Similar to Biosphere 2, I don’t count this project a failure, not at all. In Biosphere 2 they had unexpected results, but those results contributed to hundreds of research papers that furthered our understanding of our planet. In science, if you get reliable data, then you’ve succeeded. 
</p>
<p>
My mission was to raise awareness, and I could not have asked for it to be more of a success. I didn’t really plan to live-tweet the whole thing, but not long after I tweeted that I’d started the mission, I began trending on <a href="https://twitter.com/i/moments/1055070170878824453"> Twitter </a>. By the end of the day I’d made over 3 million twitter impressions, and started a real global conversation about Climate Change. I have no idea how many people saw this project on the front page of the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-45965027">  BBC </a>, on CNN, heard on <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/listen/shows/as-it-happens/segment/15620162"> CBC  </a>, or on several dozen other news sources around the world, but its in the millions.

</p>
<p>
One thing I’d like to clarify in that last video is that  <a href="http://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/climate-change-and-health"> the World Health Organization </a>
 estimates 5 million deaths based solely on human health, such as deaths by heatstroke. If you consider the additional loss of life by things like increased volatility of weather events such as hurricanes, the food shortages that will arise from drought, and many other factors, you’ll realize that 5 million deaths is a sort of minimum value. But, I’m not here to speculate on that right now.
</p>
<p>
Doing this project has fundamentally changed how I experience the air around me. Every day, when it comes to lighting a stove-top, using aerosols, or getting in a car, <b> I’ve started to ask myself “would I do this if I was sealed inside that little biodome with it?” </b>. If the answer is no, then I know I need to figure out how to remove that from my life. 
</p>
<p>
I’m vegan, and I don’t own a car, but I know there is more I need to do. I’m working on it.
